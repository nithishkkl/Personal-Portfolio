            <h3>Full Stack Developer !</h3> <br>
            <p>I am a skilled web designer with over 3 years of experience in the industry. My passion lies in
                creating captivating website designs and implementing them through frontend development.
                take pride in staying up-to-date with current design trends and leveraging my creativity to
                produce visually appealing and user-friendly websites. hroughout my career,I have
                developed a deep understanding of user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) principles
                By putting myself in the shoes of the end-users, I strive to create intuitive and seamless
                browsing experiences. I believe that a well-designed website should not only look visually
                appealing but also provide a smooth and enjoyable interaction for visitors. When starting a
                new project, I thoroughly research and analyze the target audience and the client's specific
                requirements. This enables me to tailor my designs to meet their expectations and deliver a
                unique online presence that aligns with their brand identity.</p> <br>

                <p> I have strong skills in CSS, allowing me to craft visually appealing and responsive layouts. I use CSS for designing clean and maintainable styles, focusing on creating smooth, mobile-friendly experiences. My expertise includes techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and animations, ensuring a dynamic and polished user interface.

            <p>The <span>food ordering system</span> is built using Python functions, which promotes a 
                modular design approach. 
                Each function is responsible for a specific aspect of the system, such as 
                handling user input, managing orders, or processing payments. This 
                modularity makes the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend, 
                allowing developers to make changes or add new features with minimal 
                impact on the overall system. </p>
